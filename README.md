# Nuew-Frontend-Challenge

This is a simple Frontend project that fetches images from the API Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/developers) and displays them as a three columns photo gallery (one column for mobiles).


## Background | Not using the common-readme | Not required

This project was created as a requirement to apply for the hackaton "Vueling Tech Hack" organized by NUWE (https://nuwe.io/dev/competitions/vueling-tech-hack).

## Usage
The interface is very simple: 1. when it is loaded, the images from the API are displayed in the gallery; 2. the user just has to click to the button "Cargar nuevas fotos" that is placed at the top of the webpage to make a new request to the API and get new photos displayed.

## Stack

This project only uses plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.
CSS implements a "masonry" layout basically using the "columns" property.
Javascript involves a function ("carrega()") that is called when the HTML body loads and when the button at the top of the webpage is clicked.
